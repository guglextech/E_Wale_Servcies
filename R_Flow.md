Error issues.
==============
Airtime purchase flow

✅ FIXED: The sequence bug has been resolved. The airtime flow now correctly follows:
1. Select Airtime Top-Up (sequence 2)
2. Select Network (sequence 3) 
3. Enter Mobile Number (sequence 4)
4. Enter Amount (sequence 5)
5. Confirm Order (sequence 6)

The previous issue where amount input would incorrectly trigger mobile number validation has been fixed by reordering the flow to ask for mobile number before amount.
