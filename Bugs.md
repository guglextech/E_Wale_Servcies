Data bundle fixes - issues


AT Network Bugs 


1. When i package appears and i select 1. Eg 50MB the packages appears reappears again.
 Instead of moving to the summary page. 

2. On the paginator when i select  0 for next. It returns . Please select a package. 
 The paginator should work really, extremely well for all the packages,
  dynamically. The next and back should work really well too. 
The should be no duplicated preview for the package selected. 

3. Sometime when i select back 99. it return (displays). Please select a valid category.
 It is a bug , it should take me to main menu.

4. All the paginated should be the same for all the network. 

 0. For next 
 99 For back. 



I noticed on # for the back on the paginator worked. But the 99 returns. 
Please select a valid category.

Consistent paginator for all the data bundle networks.


Fix this bug. THe code should be simple clean , short and neat
